# OOP – Object-Oriented Programming in C++
This repository contains the exercises I developed during the OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) course using C++.

## 🛠️ About the Course
In this course, we studied the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming, including classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. All exercises are implemented in C++ to reinforce practical understanding.

## 📁 Repository Contents
- Exercises focusing on class design and implementation

- Examples of inheritance and polymorphism

- Projects demonstrating encapsulation and abstraction principles

## 🎯 Objective
To organize and document the practical exercises completed during the course, providing a reference for ongoing learning and development in object-oriented programming with C++.
